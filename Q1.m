%Processor, Hard drive, RAM, Input/output devices, BUS wires.

%A processor executes commands
%The main memory stores data
%The Hard drive stores data 
%The BUS wires carry information between components
%The input devices input information and data to the computer
%The output devices output the data

%Takes more time to get information from the hard drive as it has a
%mechanical part that moves to extract data physically from different parts of the
%disc. The main memory is faster as there's no moving parts and the cpu has
%direct access to the RAM.
