a=sprintf(' Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of earth,\n And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;\n Sunward I\''ve climbed, and joined the tumbling\n mirth\n Of sun-split clouds, --and done a hundred things\n You have not dreamed of -- Wheeled and soared and\n swung\n\n High in the sunlit silence. Hov\''ring there\n I\''ve chased the shouting wind along, and flung\n My eager craft through footless halls of air...\n Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue\n I\''ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace\n Where never lark or even eagle flew --\n And, while with silent lifting mind I\''ve trod\n The high untrespassed sanctity of space.\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohn Gillespie Magee, Jr');
